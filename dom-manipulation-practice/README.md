Learning exercise from a module on DOM Manipulation & Events (JavaScript Foundations, The Odin Project): 

Lines Copy the example into files on your own computer
Supply the rest of the HTML skeleton & link your JavaScript file. 

Add the following elements to the container using ONLY JavaScript and the DOM methods shown above.

1. a `<p>` with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
2. an `<h3>` with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
3. a `<div>` with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
    - another `<h1>` that says “I’m in a div”
    - a `<p>` that says “ME TOO!”

- Hint for this one: after creating the `<div>` with createElement, append the `<h1>` and `<p>` to it before adding it to the container.
